            Most effective strategies:
            <p>Ways to promote environmental exploration to communities who have experienced less of nature than they deserve can be good for people's mental, and physical health. 
                With organizations like Outdoor Afro (linked and explained in "Root Causes" tab), folks gain first hand experience in exploring and navigating nature. Not only does it bring people together, but it also promotes environmental equity by introducing people to the local environment. 

            </p>         
            <p>Waterside Workshop, a free non-profit bike shop, provides full bike repairs while engaging you in the mechanics. </p>

          <div class="col border border-2">
           (Potential) uses of technology):
           <p>Ironically, the establishment of parks in cities is to make up for the growing industry and the growing service industry, leaving some abandoned sites. But the parkland is so far from the industry central of the East Bay, leaving the clean parks for the people who live in the hills, and the poor air quality and inaccessible roads and transportation to the city average of lower income people living in the flatlands. 
        </p>
           <p>With an app/site to make mountain biking less intimidating and more accessible to new riders, there might be more people willing to try the sport. Connecting people to experienced riders, and providing suppport and information on bike acsess, repairs, and transportation.

            Final implications
            <ul>
                <li class="text-start">My app will provide lists of trails in the East Bay of different levels. It will also show new riders how to get to the trails, with suggestions of transportation.</li>
                <li class="text-start">Related to that, I was hoping to find contacts for experienced bikers who are down to introduce people to the sport, who could potentially help with transportation.</li>
                <li class="text-start">The app will also be a portal for the team, providing information, and ways to sign up to ride and contact the current team captains.
